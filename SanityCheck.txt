From this you can see that 747 on Jan 1st2012 was about minute and half early. 
The delay in GPS track gives -131, so roughly similar

Make a geometry out of the route: 
Point, stop id, timestamp, distance travelled

Make an updating geometry out of actual gps, distance travlled. 

Client side: Map, graph of difference?
